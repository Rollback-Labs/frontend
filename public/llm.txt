# Rollback Wallet - LLM Research Guide

## What is Rollback?

Rollback is a revolutionary crypto asset protection system that automatically transfers your funds to designated recovery wallets if your primary wallet becomes inactive. It's designed to prevent permanent loss of cryptocurrency due to forgotten passwords, lost private keys, device theft, incapacitation, or other unforeseen circumstances.

## Core Problem Solved

**The Problem**: Billions of dollars in cryptocurrency are permanently lost each year due to:
- Forgotten passwords and lost private keys
- Device theft or damage
- Owner incapacitation or death
- Accidental deletion of wallet files
- Hardware wallet failures

**The Solution**: Rollback acts as a "dead man's switch" for your crypto assets, automatically transferring funds to trusted recovery wallets after a period of inactivity.

## How Rollback Works

### 1. Setup Process
- User connects their existing wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
- Configures up to 10 fallback/recovery wallet addresses
- Sets an inactivity threshold (e.g., 6 months, 1 year)
- Selects tokens to monitor (supports ERC-20 and ERC-721)
- Chooses rollback mechanism (Priority-based or Randomized)
- Deploys a personal Rollback Wallet smart contract

### 2. Monitoring Phase
- The system continuously monitors wallet activity
- Users can reset the inactivity timer through simple actions
- Real-time alerts notify users of approaching thresholds
- Dashboard shows current status and time remaining

### 3. Recovery Execution
- If no activity is detected within the threshold period
- Automated rollback process begins
- Funds are transferred to designated recovery wallets
- Priority-based or randomized distribution based on user preference

## Key Features

### Smart Contract Security
- Audited smart contracts for maximum security
- Decentralized architecture with no single point of failure
- User maintains full control until rollback conditions are met
- Immutable and transparent on-chain operations

### Multi-Token Support
- ERC-20 token monitoring and protection
- ERC-721 NFT safeguarding
- Support for multiple blockchain networks
- Expandable to additional token standards

### Flexible Configuration
- Customizable inactivity thresholds
- Multiple recovery wallet options
- Priority-based or randomized fund distribution
- Modifiable settings through governance votes

### User Experience
- Intuitive web interface
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear activity logging and analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **RollbackWalletManager**: Factory contract for creating individual rollback wallets
- **RollbackWallet**: Individual user wallet contracts with rollback functionality
- **Governance System**: Decentralized voting for parameter changes
- **Agent System**: Automated execution of rollback procedures

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Monitoring Service**: Tracks wallet activity across multiple chains
- **Alert System**: Sends notifications before rollback execution
- **Database**: Stores user configurations and activity logs
- **API Layer**: Handles frontend-backend communication

### Frontend Application
- **React/TypeScript**: Modern web application framework

- **Death**: Estate planning and inheritance execution
- **Extended Travel**: Long-term absence protection

## Security Considerations

### Decentralization
- No central authority can access or freeze funds
- Smart contracts are immutable once deployed
- Users retain full control until rollback conditions are met
- Open-source code for transparency and auditing

### Privacy Protection
- Minimal data collection and storage
- Encrypted sensitive information
- No KYC requirements for basic functionality
- Users control their own data

### Attack Vectors Mitigated
- **Social Engineering**: Cannot bypass smart contract logic
- **Centralized Failures**: No single point of failure
- **Regulatory Seizure**: Decentralized architecture
- **Internal Threats**: Trustless system design

## Governance and Voting

### Decentralized Governance
- Token-based voting system
- Proposals for parameter changes
- Community-driven development
- Transparent decision-making process

### Voting Mechanisms
- **Threshold Changes**: Modify inactivity periods
- **Agent Updates**: Change automated execution systems
- **Feature Proposals**: Add new functionality
- **Security Updates**: Emergency protocol changes

## Economic Model
