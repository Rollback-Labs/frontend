# Rollback

A revolutionary cryptocurrency safety solution that automatically protects your digital assets from being lost forever.

## 🎯 What is Rollback?

Rollback is a smart contract-based safety net for cryptocurrency holders. It automatically monitors your wallet activity and, if inactivity is detected, transfers your funds to designated fallback wallets. This prevents the permanent loss of crypto assets due to:

- Lost private keys
- Forgotten passwords
- Hardware failures
- Death of asset owners
- Technical errors

## 💡 Why Rollback?

- **$140 Billion Problem**: Over $140 billion worth of Bitcoin is estimated to be inaccessible due to lost private keys
- **Permanent Loss Prevention**: Traditional blockchain systems have no built-in recovery mechanisms
- **Peace of Mind**: Automatic monitoring and transfer system ensures your assets remain accessible
- **Complete Control**: You maintain full control over timeframes, conditions, and destination wallets
- **Multi-Token Support**: Works with various cryptocurrencies

## 🔒 How It Works

1. **Setup**: Configure your primary wallet and designate fallback wallets
2. **Monitoring**: Smart contracts continuously monitor your wallet activity
3. **Safety Net**: If inactivity is detected, funds are automatically transferred to your fallback wallets
4. **Security**: Multiple security parameters ensure assets are only transferred when necessary
